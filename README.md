I expect this subject to teach me how different parts of a computer system or software can connect and work together. I want to understand how hardware, software, and networks are combined to create one working system. This will help me see how technology is built in real life, not just as separate tools but as one whole system.

I also expect to learn skills that I can use in real situations, like designing and analyzing systems that are efficient and easy to use. I believe this subject will guide me on how systems are planned, organized, and connected. It will also show me how companies use integration to make their technology faster and more reliable.

Lastly, I hope this subject will improve my problem-solving and critical thinking. System integration has many challenges, and I want to learn how to solve them in simple ways. I expect that this subject will prepare me for future jobs in IT by teaching me how to build and manage systems that can help people and organizations.
